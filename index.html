                <h2>The King</h2>
                <p>
                <b> Virat Kohli</b> (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national
                     cricket team who plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Considered to be one 
                     of the best cricketers in the world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport.
                     Nicknamed "The King", due to his dominant style of play and popularity, Kohli holds numerous records in his career across 
                     all formats. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also
                      contributed to India's successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022, and winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 
                      Champions trophy. He is among the only four Indian cricketers who have played over 500 matches for India.

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <P>
                    Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a
                     criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older 
                     sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal
                      Bharti Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere 
                    three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.
                </P>
                <p>
                    In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, espoused his 
                    younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar
                     Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks 
                     later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.Upon the suggestion of their neighbours,
                      Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing
                       abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket.Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of 
                       being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors.
                        Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but 
                        he declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit
                         and overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).
                     Kohli persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.He received training at the
                     academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara 
                        Enclave.As per Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days at his academy, he exuded remarkable talent,
                         making it arduous for the coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, 
                         Sharma had to physically coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart.In pursuit of
                          furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.
                          Kohli's ardent passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he never
                           missed a match. With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding
                            respect from the local bowlers.
